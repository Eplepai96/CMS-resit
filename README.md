# CMS-resit

Posts are displaying, and updates on WordPress are pulling through correctly. The only styling I added was width of images, so it's a little easier to look at. I would actually like to style more, but want to keep it clean so it's faster for you to review. Hope it's fine that I used Netlify for deployment, otherwise please let me know.
